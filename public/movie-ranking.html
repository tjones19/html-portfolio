<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Castle in the Sky</h3>
<p>I loved the idea of a castle flouting high above the clouds, unlocked by a girl and her magic pendant.</p>
<h3>Last Holiday</h3>
<p>Wonferful film about living life like you're running out of time.</p>
<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>One of the few movies that actually made me laugh out loud - wonderful creation from a concept I grew up with.</p>
